    Your Solution to Re-Charging EV Vehicles.
  </p>
  This project explores the practicality of using electric vehicles by examining the CO2 footprint, and also we can compare the EV-EV, ICEV-EV vehical's efficiency,their carbon emission along with the average distance which can be travlled by the ev's.For better user experience project also includes news related to the EV's on the daily basis.

Additionally,this project also contains calulator of savings where by entering the EV model and the average distance you travel with car everyday tells you the cost and estimated saving and also by entering the percentage of charging you can easily get the total distance you can travel by the remaining amount of charging.

## Why ChargeTRON ?

Electric vehicles have been emerging as a significant response to the current climate crisis, providing a novel way to reduce global greenhouse gas emissions. EVs will make up 10% of global passenger vehicle sales in 2025, 28% in 2030 and 58% in 2040. EVs will make up 31% of all cars on the road in 2040, 67% of municipal buses, 47% of two-wheeled vehicles and 24% of light commercial vehicles.

Suppose you are a EV owner, you are out on a trip and you suddenly realise that you have to recharge your EV. You are not sure where to recharge your EV. You are not sure if the EV charging station is open or has the suitable charger for your vehicle. This is where EV-Sathi comes in.

Our Webapplication uses a cost-effective solution for EV owners to find the nearest charging station and recharge their vehicles. It also supports booking of charging stations for those who want to recharge their vehicles at a scheduled time.The dynamic nature of the application makes it easy to manage multiple vehicles from one device.


## Key Features Implemented

- Awesome UX and easy to use friendly interface

- Manage multiple vehicles from one device

- Find the charging stations near you in a Built-in Map with real-time location updates

- Get status of EV charging stations along with distance, chargers, etc.

- Get a dyanamic price while booking slot for your EV based on currently free slots.

- Navigation system to help you find the charging station in a short time using Direction and Places API.

- View booking history of your EV

- Estimate cost and time for your EV in a journey with an awesome Pricing Calculator.

### Tech Stacks
**Web Application**
  - React Js
  - Bootstrap
  - JQuery

**Mobile Applicaton:**

- Flutter
- Firebase
-Android Studio
 
*NOTE* This application is based on webview and is available in its utmost alpha phase.

## Getting Started

You can test ChargeTRON in your own development environment.

## Prerequisites

You'll need to set up the IDE and django with Android Studi, or any mobile testing device on your local system.

**Flutter Environment: You'll need to have the following installed:**

1. [Flutter SDK](https://flutter.dev/docs/get-started/install)
2. [Android Studio](https://developer.android.com/studio)

***Ensure you are testing the app using Flutter version [2.10.3](https://docs.flutter.dev/development/tools/sdk/releases?tab=windows) and above.***

*For checking flutter version:*

- Run flutter --version in terminal

If your version is not upto date, follow these steps to upgrade:

- flutter channel stable to switch to the channel having stable version of flutter updates
- flutter upgrade to get the latest flutter version

### *Development Environment: For setting up the development environment, follow the steps given below.*

- Clone this repository after forking using git clone <https://github.com/mihiragarwal92/ChargeTRON.github.io>
- Check for JQuery setup and connected devices 
- Get all the dependencies using `BootStrap 4.0.1` .

- **Run the Webapp using `index.html`**

  <H2>**NOVELTY**</h2><BR>
Electric vehicle (EV) services offer several novel features that differentiate them from traditional gasoline-powered vehicle services. Here are a few examples:
Sustainability initiatives: EV services can have a strong focus on sustainability, with initiatives such as using renewable energy to power their charging stations, using recycled materials in their vehicles and charging infrastructure, and offering car-sharing programs to reduce the number of cars on the road.
Charging infrastructure: EV services need to provide charging infrastructure to their customers. This infrastructure can take the form of public charging stations or charging stations at the company's own facilities. The design and implementation of the charging infrastructure is crucial to providing a convenient and reliable service to EV customers.

Range anxiety solutions: Range anxiety is a common concern among EV owners, as they worry about running out of battery charge on longer trips. EV services can provide solutions to range anxiety, such as offering a network of charging stations along common travel routes or offering electric vehicles with longer battery ranges.


Feasibility

the feasibility of an idea depends on a combination of factors, including resources, skills and expertise, impact and viability, innovation and originality, and collaboration and teamwork


i) co2 emission calculator- A CO2 emission calculator is a tool that estimates the amount of carbon dioxide (CO2) emissions generated by an individual, organization, or event based on various inputs. 
ii) Saving Calculator-Saving calculator calcuates the cost an etimated saving by entering the vehiclle brand and the average distance you travel everyday.
iii)Compare different EV vehicles
