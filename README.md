    Your Solution to Re-Charging EV Vehicles.
  </p>
  This project explores the practicality of using electric vehicles by examining the CO2 footprint, and also we can compare the EV-EV, ICEV-EV vehical's efficiency,their carbon emission along with the average distance which can be travlled by the ev's.For better user experience project also includes news related to the EV's on the daily basis.

Additionally,this project also contains calulator of savings where by entering the EV model and the average distance you travel with car everyday tells you the cost and estimated saving and also by entering the percentage of charging you can easily get the total distance you can travel by the remaining amount of charging.

## Why ChargeTRON ?

Electric vehicles have been emerging as a significant response to the current climate crisis, providing a novel way to reduce global greenhouse gas emissions. EVs will make up 10% of global passenger vehicle sales in 2025, 28% in 2030 and 58% in 2040. EVs will make up 31% of all cars on the road in 2040, 67% of municipal buses, 47% of two-wheeled vehicles and 24% of light commercial vehicles.

Suppose you are a EV owner, you are out on a trip and you suddenly realise that you have to recharge your EV. You are not sure where to recharge your EV. You are not sure if the EV charging station is open or has the suitable charger for your vehicle. This is where EV-Sathi comes in.

Our Webapplication uses a cost-effective solution for EV owners to find the nearest charging station and recharge their vehicles. It also supports booking of charging stations for those who want to recharge their vehicles at a scheduled time.The dynamic nature of the application makes it easy to manage multiple vehicles from one device.


## Key Features Implemented

- Awesome UX and easy to use friendly interface

- Manage multiple vehicles from one device

- Find the charging stations near you in a Built-in Map with real-time location updates

- Get status of EV charging stations along with distance, chargers, etc.

- Get a dyanamic price while booking slot for your EV based on currently free slots.

- Navigation system to help you find the charging station in a short time using Direction and Places API.

- View booking history of your EV

- Estimate cost and time for your EV in a journey with an awesome Pricing Calculator.

### Tech Stacks
